# Parkinsons_disease_prediction-
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement. Symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and impaired balance. It's caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. While there's no cure, treatments such as medication and therapy can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for patients.

<h1>predicting if a person has Parkinsons using ML support vector classifier </h1>
Using machine learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM) models analyze patient data like tremor patterns and speech characteristics to predict Parkinson's disease onset. By training on labeled datasets, SVMs learn to classify individuals at risk. This proactive approach enables early intervention, enhancing treatment efficacy and potentially slowing disease progression.
