Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement. Symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and impaired balance. It's caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. While there's no cure, treatments such as medication and therapy can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for patients.
